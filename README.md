# ROS Android Sensors

Ros Interface to Android Sensors!

Heavily Inspired by [ros\_android\_sensors\_driver](https://github.com/ros-android/android_sensors_driver) during development.

Currently Supporting Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) API 23

Intended for Aiding Robot Navigation and Localization

List of Supported Sensors:

- [x] GPS
- [x] Gyroscope
- [x] Accelerometer
- [x] Magnetometer
- [x] Barometer
- [ ] Camera
- [ ] Microphone

Other Tasks:

- Revise Covariance Matrices dynamically based on professed sensor accuracy
- Consider Odometry Visualization with onboard Kalman filter?
- Consider Serial Communication, or other modes of connection with the robot
